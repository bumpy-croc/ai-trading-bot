## Critical Fixes Applied (PR Review Response)

After the initial documentation enhancements, automated code review identified 10 critical issues where documentation didn't match the actual codebase. All issues have been addressed:

### Issues Fixed

1. **✅ Optimizer CLI syntax** - Corrected from `atb optimizer run` to `atb optimizer`
2. **✅ Non-existent analyze command** - Removed `atb optimizer analyze` references
3. **✅ OptimizerRunner class** - Updated to use actual `ExperimentRunner` class
4. **✅ ParameterRange class** - Removed references (doesn't exist), updated to use `ParameterSet`
5. **✅ OptimizerAnalyzer class** - Corrected to `PerformanceAnalyzer`
6. **✅ RegimeConfig parameters** - Fixed to use actual fields: `slope_window`, `atr_window`, `hysteresis_k`, etc.
7. **✅ RegimeDetector method** - Updated to use `annotate()` method instead of non-existent `detect_current_regime()`
8. **✅ EnhancedRegimeDetector API** - Simplified example to match actual implementation
9. **✅ Indicator function names** - Corrected all to use `calculate_*` prefix (e.g., `calculate_sma` not `calc_sma`)
10. **✅ Performance metrics functions** - Fixed to use actual function names: `sharpe`, `max_drawdown` (not `perf_*`)
11. **✅ Monitoring file references** - Corrected to `dashboard.py` instead of non-existent `app.py`

### Verification

All corrected examples have been verified against actual source code:
- ✓ CLI commands match `cli/commands/*.py` implementations
- ✓ Class names match actual imports
- ✓ Method signatures match actual implementations
- ✓ Function names match actual definitions
- ✓ File paths match actual directory structure

## Conclusion

This documentation maintenance session successfully:
- ✅ Enhanced 7 critical module READMEs from minimal stubs to comprehensive guides
- ✅ Fixed 11 critical accuracy issues identified in code review
- ✅ Improved documentation consistency across the repository
- ✅ Added practical usage examples throughout
- ✅ Verified all content accuracy against current codebase
- ✅ Established documentation quality standards
- ✅ Provided foundation for ongoing documentation maintenance

The documentation is now significantly more useful **and accurate** for developers working with the AI Trading Bot repository. All changes maintain the existing structure and style while dramatically improving content quality, completeness, and correctness.

**No behavioral changes were made** - all updates are documentation-only as required.
