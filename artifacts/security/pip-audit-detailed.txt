scikit-learn 1.3.2   PYSEC-2024-110      1.5.0                A sensitive data leakage vulnerability was identified in scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer, specifically in versions up to and including 1.4.1.post1, which was fixed in version 1.5.0. The vulnerability arises from the unexpected storage of all tokens present in the training data within the `stop_words_` attribute, rather than only storing the subset of tokens required for the TF-IDF technique to function. This behavior leads to the potential leakage of sensitive information, as the `stop_words_` attribute could contain tokens that were meant to be discarded and not stored, such as passwords or keys. The impact of this vulnerability varies based on the nature of the data being processed by the vectorizer.
requests     2.31.0  GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56 2.32.0               When making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same origin will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection in the connection pool.  ### Remediation Any of these options can be used to remediate the current issue, we highly recommend upgrading as the preferred mitigation.  * Upgrade to `requests>=2.32.0`. * For `requests<2.32.0`, avoid setting `verify=False` for the first request to a host while using a Requests Session. * For `requests<2.32.0`, call `close()` on `Session` objects to clear existing connections if `verify=False` is used.  ### Related Links * https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6655
requests     2.31.0  GHSA-9hjg-9r4m-mvj7 2.32.4               ### Impact  Due to a URL parsing issue, Requests releases prior to 2.32.4 may leak .netrc credentials to third parties for specific maliciously-crafted URLs.  ### Workarounds For older versions of Requests, use of the .netrc file can be disabled with `trust_env=False` on your Requests Session ([docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.Session.trust_env)).  ### References https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6965 https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/Jun/2
nltk         3.8.1   PYSEC-2024-167      3.9                  NLTK through 3.8.1 allows remote code execution if untrusted packages have pickled Python code, and the integrated data package download functionality is used. This affects, for example, averaged_perceptron_tagger and punkt.
eventlet     0.35.1  GHSA-3rq5-2g8h-59hc 0.35.2               eventlet before 0.35.2, as used in dnspython before 2.6.0, allows remote attackers to interfere with DNS name resolution by quickly sending an invalid packet from the expected IP address and source port, aka a "TuDoor" attack. In other words, dnspython does not have the preferred behavior in which the DNS name resolution algorithm would proceed, within the full time window, in order to wait for a valid packet. NOTE: dnspython 2.6.0 is unusable for a different reason that was addressed in 2.6.1.
protobuf     3.20.3  GHSA-8qvm-5x2c-j2w7 4.25.8,5.29.5,6.31.1 ### Summary Any project that uses Protobuf pure-Python backend to parse untrusted Protocol Buffers data containing an arbitrary number of **recursive groups**, **recursive messages** or **a series of [`SGROUP`](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/#groups) tags** can be corrupted by exceeding the Python recursion limit.  Reporter: Alexis Challande, Trail of Bits Ecosystem Security Team [ecosystem@trailofbits.com](mailto:ecosystem@trailofbits.com)  Affected versions: This issue only affects the [pure-Python implementation](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/main/python#implementation-backends) of protobuf-python backend. This is the implementation when `PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python` environment variable is set or the default when protobuf is used from Bazel or pure-Python PyPi wheels. CPython PyPi wheels do not use pure-Python by default.  This is a Python variant of a [previous issue affecting protobuf-java](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-735f-pc8j-v9w8).  ### Severity This is a potential Denial of Service. Parsing nested protobuf data creates unbounded recursions that can be abused by an attacker.  ### Proof of Concept For reproduction details, please refer to the unit tests [decoder_test.py](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/python/google/protobuf/internal/decoder_test.py#L87-L98) and [message_test](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/python/google/protobuf/internal/message_test.py#L1436-L1478)  ### Remediation and Mitigation A mitigation is available now. Please update to the latest available versions of the following packages: * protobuf-python(4.25.8, 5.29.5, 6.31.1)
