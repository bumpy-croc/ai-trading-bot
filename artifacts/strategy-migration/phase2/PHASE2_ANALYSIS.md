# Phase 2 Benchmark Analysis: Migration Impact Assessment

**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Context**: Strategy Migration Proposal - Phase 2 Engine Integration Analysis  
**Reference**: `docs/strategy_migration_proposal.md`

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 benchmarks reveal **significant behavioral drift** between baseline (Phase 0) and current implementations. This analysis identifies critical issues that must be addressed before proceeding with runtime integration work described in the migration proposal.

### üö® Critical Findings

1. **Trade count explosion**: ml_basic strategy generated 300 trades vs baseline 9 trades (3233% increase)
2. **Live trading activation**: Baseline live mode produced 0 trades; Phase 2 produced 50 trades
3. **Performance variance**: Behavioral changes occurred despite using identical market data (seed=42)
4. **RegimeDetector errors**: Non-critical but widespread missing method errors throughout execution

## Detailed Comparison: Baseline vs Phase 2

### ml_basic Strategy - Backtest Mode

| Metric | Baseline (Phase 0) | Phase 2 | Delta | % Change |
|--------|-------------------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Total Trades** | 9 | 300 | +291 | +3233% |
| **Final Balance** | $10,104.13 | $10,147.26 | +$43.13 | +0.43% |
| **Total Return %** | 1.04% | 1.47% | +0.43% | +41.3% |
| **Win Rate %** | 44.44% | 50.00% | +5.56% | +12.5% |
| **Max Drawdown %** | 4.04% | 3.01% | -1.03% | -25.5% |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.97 | 1.67 | +0.70 | +72.2% |
| **Wall Time (s)** | 4.87 | 3.42 | -1.45 | -29.8% |
| **CPU Time (s)** | 7.58 | 3.33 | -4.25 | -56.1% |

**Analysis**: The dramatic increase in trade count suggests a fundamental change in entry/exit logic. Surprisingly, despite 33x more trades, the final return only increased by 41%, indicating much smaller position sizes or tighter stop losses. The performance improvement (both speed and Sharpe ratio) is suspicious and warrants investigation.

### ml_basic Strategy - Live Paper Trading Mode

| Metric | Baseline (Phase 0) | Phase 2 | Delta | % Change |
|--------|-------------------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Steps** | 20 | 50 | +30 | +150% |
| **Total Trades** | 0 | 50 | +50 | N/A |
| **Final Balance** | $10,000.00 | $10,034.66 | +$34.66 | +0.35% |
| **Total Return %** | 0.00% | 0.35% | +0.35% | N/A |
| **Win Rate %** | 0% | 56.00% | +56% | N/A |
| **Max Drawdown %** | 0.00% | 0.16% | +0.16% | N/A |
| **Wall Time (s)** | 43.11 | 68.41 | +25.30 | +58.7% |
| **CPU Time (s)** | 2.38 | 16.28 | +13.90 | +583.8% |

**Analysis**: The baseline produced **zero trades** in live mode, which indicates either:
1. Entry conditions were never met in the baseline run
2. Different random seed for market data generation
3. A bug in the baseline live trading setup

Phase 2 shows 1 trade per step (50 trades in 50 steps), suggesting very aggressive entry/exit behavior. The 584% increase in CPU time is concerning for production deployment.

### ml_adaptive Strategy - Backtest Mode

| Metric | Baseline (Phase 0) | Phase 2 | Delta | % Change |
|--------|-------------------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Total Trades** | N/A | 300 | N/A | N/A |
| **Final Balance** | N/A | $10,147.26 | N/A | N/A |
| **Total Return %** | N/A | 1.47% | N/A | N/A |
| **Win Rate %** | N/A | 50.00% | N/A | N/A |
| **Wall Time (s)** | N/A | 1.33 | N/A | N/A |
| **CPU Time (s)** | N/A | 1.32 | N/A | N/A |

**Analysis**: No baseline exists for ml_adaptive. Notable that ml_adaptive is **61% faster** than ml_basic in backtest mode (1.33s vs 3.42s) despite producing identical results. This suggests ml_adaptive has better optimization or caching.

### ml_adaptive Strategy - Live Paper Trading Mode

| Metric | Baseline (Phase 0) | Phase 2 | Delta | % Change |
|--------|-------------------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Steps** | N/A | 50 | N/A | N/A |
| **Total Trades** | N/A | 50 | N/A | N/A |
| **Final Balance** | N/A | $9,990.69 | N/A | N/A |
| **Total Return %** | N/A | -0.09% | N/A | N/A |
| **Win Rate %** | N/A | 48.00% | N/A | N/A |
| **Wall Time (s)** | N/A | 52.20 | N/A | N/A |
| **CPU Time (s)** | N/A | 1.79 | N/A | N/A |

**Analysis**: ml_adaptive shows a small loss in live mode (-0.09%) compared to ml_basic's gain (+0.35%). However, it's **91% faster** in CPU time (1.79s vs 16.28s), making it significantly more efficient for live deployment.

## Implications for Migration Proposal

### Phase 2: Engine Integration (Current Phase)

The migration proposal states:
> "Side-by-side regression harness that replays datasets through both engines (legacy vs runtime) and asserts identical trade sequences, PnL, and risk metrics."

**Status**: ‚ùå **BLOCKED** - Current results show non-identical behavior:
- Trade sequences differ dramatically (9 vs 300 trades)
- PnL differs by 41% (though both profitable)
- Risk metrics show different drawdown profiles

**Required Actions Before Proceeding**:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Investigate what changed between baseline and Phase 2 runs
   - Verify both runs used identical:
     - Market data (same seed, same MockDataProvider parameters)
     - Strategy parameters
     - Risk parameters
     - Entry/exit conditions
   
2. **Behavioral Parity Verification**
   - Re-run baseline with Phase 2 parameters to isolate changes
   - Document intentional vs unintentional differences
   - Establish whether 300 trades or 9 trades is correct behavior
   
3. **Live Mode Investigation**
   - Determine why baseline live mode produced 0 trades
   - Verify Phase 2 live mode 1:1 trade-to-step ratio is expected
   - Profile CPU usage spike (584% increase)

### Feature Preparation and Caching (Proposal Section 2)

The proposal emphasizes:
> "To keep backtesting fast, indicator work must remain vectorised."

**Status**: ‚úÖ **POSITIVE** - Phase 2 shows performance improvements:
- 30% faster wall time for ml_basic backtest
- 56% faster CPU time for ml_basic backtest
- ml_adaptive is exceptionally fast (1.33s for 721 rows)

**Concern**: The speed improvement alongside behavioral changes suggests potential issues with feature computation. The vectorization may be working differently than in the baseline.

### Risk Mitigation (Proposal Section)

The proposal warns:
> "Performance regressions ‚Äì Benchmark backtests before and after runtime integration using representative datasets"

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY MET**
- Performance improved (not regressed)
- But behavioral drift occurred
- Need to verify if speed gains came at cost of correctness

> "Behavioural drift ‚Äì Use regression tests and audit trail tooling to compare trade sequences"

**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILED** - Clear behavioral drift detected:
- Trade count mismatch indicates fundamental strategy behavior change
- No audit trail comparison performed yet
- Need detailed trade-by-trade analysis

## Technical Issues Identified

### 1. RegimeDetector Errors

Throughout both Phase 2 runs, numerous errors appear:
```
Error detecting regime at index X: 'RegimeDetector' object has no attribute 'detect_regime'
Error calculating indicators: 'RegimeDetector' object has no attribute 'base_detector'
```

**Impact**: 
- Currently non-fatal (strategies continue executing)
- May impact regime-aware strategies when implemented
- Indicates incomplete refactoring or missing method implementations

**Recommendation**: Fix before runtime integration to avoid compounding issues.

### 2. MockDataProvider Seed Inconsistency

Baseline and Phase 2 used different seeds:
- Baseline: `seed=42` (backtest), `seed=1337` (live)
- Phase 2: `seed=42` (backtest), `seed=1337` (live)

Seeds appear identical, but market data generation may have changed. This needs verification.

### 3. Live Trading Step Count Mismatch

- Baseline: 20 steps
- Phase 2: 50 steps

This alone could explain behavioral differences in live mode, but doesn't explain backtest divergence.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Phase 2 Completion)

1. **Establish Ground Truth**
   - Re-run baseline benchmarks with current codebase
   - Document any known strategy changes since baseline capture
   - Create a "known differences" document if changes were intentional

2. **Implement Regression Testing**
   - Add trade sequence comparison tooling
   - Generate trade-by-trade diff between baseline and Phase 2
   - Flag any differences beyond expected variance

3. **Fix RegimeDetector**
   - Implement missing `detect_regime` method
   - Add `base_detector` attribute
   - Ensure all regime detection code is functional

4. **Profile Performance Changes**
   - Investigate why ml_basic CPU time improved by 56%
   - Verify feature calculation is still correct
   - Ensure vectorization didn't skip required computations

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria

Before marking Phase 2 complete and moving to Phase 3:

- [ ] Root cause of trade count discrepancy identified and documented
- [ ] Behavioral parity established OR differences justified
- [ ] RegimeDetector errors resolved
- [ ] Live mode 0-trade baseline issue explained
- [ ] Performance improvements validated as legitimate
- [ ] Regression test suite implemented and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated with findings

### Modified Phase 2 Timeline

Given these findings, recommend:

1. **Phase 2A**: Investigation & Parity Restoration (current focus)
2. **Phase 2B**: Runtime Integration (as originally planned)
3. **Phase 2C**: Validation & Artifacts (enhanced scope)

## Conclusion

Phase 2 benchmarks successfully captured current system performance but revealed critical behavioral drift that must be addressed before proceeding with runtime integration. The dramatic increase in trade frequency (9 ‚Üí 300) and activation of live trading (0 ‚Üí 50 trades) indicates fundamental strategy logic changes that were either:

1. **Intentional improvements** that need documentation, or
2. **Unintended regressions** that need fixes

The performance improvements (faster execution, better Sharpe ratio) are encouraging but must be validated as legitimate rather than artifacts of skipped computations or changed logic.

**Next Step**: Create detailed trade-by-trade comparison between baseline and Phase 2 to identify exact points of divergence.
