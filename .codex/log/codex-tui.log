+# Crypto Trend-Following Trading Bot Constitution
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### Code Quality Is a Shipping Criterion
+**Non-negotiable rules**
+- Every change MUST keep `make code-quality` (Black, Ruff, MyPy, Bandit) green before review.
+- All Python modules MUST be fully type hinted and document complex flows at module or function level.
+- Domain boundaries in `src/` MUST remain acyclic; cross-domain imports require an architecture note in
+  the relevant spec or plan justifying the dependency.
+**Rationale**: This codebase powers trading decisions where silent regressions compound risk; disciplined
+quality gates preserve maintainability and reviewer trust.
+
+### Testing Proves Every Change
+**Non-negotiable rules**
+- `make test` (parallel pytest) MUST pass locally or in CI before merge; skipped tests require
+  issue-linked justification.
+- New behaviour MUST land with automated tests that fail without the change; choose unit, integration,
+  and performance suites matching the impacted layer.
+- `coverage.xml` MUST show non-decreasing overall line-rate (tolerance 0.5 percentage points); any
+  regression requires a remediation plan captured in the PR description.
+**Rationale**: Trading automation depends on deterministic evidence; tests provide the only defensible
+proof that strategies and safeguards still behave as designed.
+
+### Consistent User Experience
+**Non-negotiable rules**
+- CLI commands, dashboards, and docs MUST expose clear naming, flag semantics, and help text consistent
+  with existing `atb` interfaces; new flows require README or docs updates before release.
+- User-facing changes MUST capture success and error states via structured logging that references the
+  command or dashboard module and includes remediation hints.
+- Dashboards and CLIs MUST supply safe defaults (paper trading, dry runs, or preview outputs) unless the
+  user explicitly opts into live execution.
+**Rationale**: Consistency reduces operational load and enables traders and analysts to trust behaviour
+across automation, dashboards, and manuals.
+
+### Performance Safeguards Decisions
+**Non-negotiable rules**
+- Trading loops and backtests MUST maintain published baselines: p95 loop latency ≤500ms for
+  single-symbol live trading and completion of `make backtest STRATEGY=ml_basic DAYS=30` within 5 minutes
+  on reference hardware (8 vCPU / 16GB RAM). Deviations >10% require a documented mitigation timeline.
+- Performance-sensitive code MUST emit metrics (structured logs or stats) that tie latency to strategy,
+  exchange, and workload so regressions can be triaged.
+- Any change touching `src/backtesting`, `src/live`, `src/performance`, or `tests/performance` MUST rerun
+  the performance suite (`pytest tests/performance -q`) and attach results to the PR.
+**Rationale**: Latency and throughput govern execution quality; explicit SLOs and instrumentation keep
+strategies profitable and alerts actionable.
+
+## Quality Gate Requirements
+Teams MUST satisfy these checks before implementation work begins and again before requesting review:
+
+- Align plan.md Constitution Check with all four principles, explicitly noting how code quality, testing,
+  UX, and performance obligations are met or mitigated.
+- Run `make code-quality`, `make test`, and relevant `pytest tests/performance` slices locally; CI logs
+  MUST be linked in the PR.
+- Update specs/tasks to include mandatory testing tasks, UX artefacts (docs, screenshots, CLI help), and
+  performance validation steps; missing artefacts block merge.
+- Document any exceptions (with expiry dates) in the PR checklist and track follow-up issues in `docs/`
+  or `artifacts/` as appropriate.
+
+## Delivery Workflow & Documentation
+- Feature work MUST follow the `/specs/[feature]/` lifecycle: research → plan → spec → tasks, keeping
+  user stories independently deliverable and testable.
+- Plans MUST describe the affected domains under `src/` and how dependencies preserve the constitution's
+  quality and performance guarantees.
+- Specs MUST articulate measurable UX outcomes (CLI, dashboard, API) and include acceptance criteria that
+  map to automated tests.
+- Tasks MUST enumerate required test cases, documentation updates, and performance validation steps,
+  enabling reviewers to correlate implementation progress with principle compliance.
+
+## Governance
+- Amendments require consensus from maintainers responsible for trading, ML, and platform domains plus a
+  documented impact analysis; approve via PR referencing the analysis in `docs/`.
+- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for removing or redefining principles, MINOR for adding new
+  principles or clauses, PATCH for clarifications. Record version bumps in this file and PR titles.
+- Compliance is reviewed during PR triage and quarterly audits; audits MUST sample merged work against
+  each principle and track gaps in `docs/governance.md`.

 ## Constitution Check
 
 *GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
 
-[Gates determined based on constitution file]
+- **Code Quality Is a Shipping Criterion**: Identify touched modules, confirm the change will keep
+  `make code-quality` passing, and note any cross-domain dependencies that require explicit justification.
+- **Testing Proves Every Change**: List the automated tests that will fail before implementation and how
+  unit, integration, and performance coverage will be updated; include expected coverage impact.
+- **Consistent User Experience**: Describe UX artefacts (CLI help, dashboard updates, docs) needed to keep
+  interactions consistent and the structured logging that will evidence success/error states.
+- **Performance Safeguards Decisions**: Provide baseline metrics or performance tests to rerun, acceptance
+  thresholds, and instrumentation required to detect regressions.

 ## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*
 
 <!--
   IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
   Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
   you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
 
   Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
   Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
   - Developed independently
   - Tested independently
   - Deployed independently
   - Demonstrated to users independently
+
+  Map every story to automated tests that will fail before implementation (unit, integration, performance)
+  and note any coverage impact or new fixtures required.

 ### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
 
 - **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
 - **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
 
+### UX Consistency Requirements *(mandatory when user-facing)*
+
+- **UX-001**: Interfaces MUST [describe CLI/dashboard behaviour, help text updates, safe defaults]
+- **UX-002**: Logging MUST [capture success/error states with remediation hints]
+- **UX-003**: Documentation MUST [list README/docs artefacts that change]
+
+### Performance Requirements *(mandatory when impacting runtime paths)*
+
+- **PERF-001**: System MUST [define latency/throughput target aligned with constitution SLOs]
+- **PERF-002**: Performance test suite MUST [identify pytest command or benchmark to rerun]
+- **PERF-003**: Instrumentation MUST [describe metrics/logs to capture for regression tracking]
