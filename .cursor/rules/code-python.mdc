# Python Specific Code Quality


- Avoid unintended global variable caching because in Python servers, global variables persist across requests, causing data leaks and race conditions.
- Use named arguments for clarity
- Don't place assignments inside conditionals
- Adhere to the Google Python Style Guide.
- Use Google Style Docstrings.
- Use `tqdm` whenever I ask to add a progress bar.
- Use vectorized operations where possible or `itertubles()` over `iterrows()` when loopiung through data frames.

## Linting
- Run linting checks with `ruff` on the files changed before finishing any job`

## Security
- Use parameterised queries instead of f string where possible to avoid SQL injection

## Logging
- Use Python logging module, not print
- Levels: DEBUG (dev), INFO (events), WARNING (issues), ERROR (failures)
- Include context in messages
