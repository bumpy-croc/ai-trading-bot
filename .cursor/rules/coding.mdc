## Comments
- Only comment what is truly useful and ads value
- When writting comments, avoid referencing points in time, PRs, chats or reasons for the code change. Use simple language that describes the context

## Documentation
- Don't create excess documentation. When you do, it should live in the `docs` folder.

## Git
- Important: Never commit to git unless specifically asked to!
