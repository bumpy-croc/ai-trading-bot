- Start simple (5â€“8 features), add complexity only with validation gains.
- Use time-based CV; avoid random splits. Validate across regimes.
- Monitor training vs validation gap; >10% suggests overfitting.
- Prefer interpretable features (returns, volatility, RSI). Avoid leakage.
- Keep ONNX for inference; include metadata JSON alongside models.
- Paper trade before live; monitor drift and retrain on schedule.
