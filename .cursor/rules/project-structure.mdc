- All stratgies inherit from a base class. 
- Each strategy only contains the necessary code for that strategy. 
- Any code related to executing a backtest or running the strategy lives in backtest.py.

## Backtesting
- When I ask you to run a backtest with a specific strategy and number of days, use the `run_backtest.py` script. For example, to run a backtest with the adaptive strategy for the last 100 days you would run `python run_backtest.py adaptive --days 100`

## Strategies
- All startegies live in the /strategies folder and extend the BaseStrategy class.
- When asked to create a new strategy, be sure to keep to the same structure as the existing strategies.
