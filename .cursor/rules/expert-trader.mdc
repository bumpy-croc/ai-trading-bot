Long-Term Crypto Trading Strategy: "Trend-Following With Risk Containment"
ðŸ§­ Core Principles:
Trade with the trend, not against it

Avoid over-trading and emotional decisions

Use tight risk management to preserve capital

Let profits compound over time

ðŸ§© Strategy Components
1. Asset Selection
Stick to high-liquidity, established cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX).

Optionally diversify into promising Layer 1s or altcoins with solid fundamentals and tech.

2. Timeframe
Use daily (1D) and weekly (1W) charts for analysis.

Trade less frequently, focus on macro trends, not intraday noise.

3. Entry Criteria
Use a confluence of signals to enter trades:

Trend confirmation:

50 EMA > 200 EMA (bullish trend)

Price breakout above key resistance or a higher low on strong volume

Relative Strength Index (RSI) between 40â€“60 (not overbought/sold)

ðŸ’¡ Optional: Add on-chain indicators (if available) or sentiment indicators for broader context.

4. Risk Management
Risk only 1â€“2% of total capital per trade

Use position sizing based on stop loss (we can create a calculator for this)

5. Stop Loss Strategy
Place below recent swing low (long) or above swing high (short)

Or use a technical support/resistance zone

Adjust as the trade moves in your favor (trailing stop)

6. Take Profit Strategy
Use a Risk:Reward ratio of at least 1:2 or 1:3

Consider partial profit-taking at key resistance levels, and let the rest run

Use trailing stops to ride strong trends

7. Exits & Re-Entries
Exit if price breaks trend structure (e.g., lower low in an uptrend)

Be prepared to re-enter if the trend resumes

Donâ€™t marry your bags â€” preserve capital

8. Journal & Review
Log every trade (entry, exit, reason, outcome)

Review weekly or monthly

Identify emotional decisions, premature exits, and pattern inconsistencies

ðŸ›  Tools You Might Use:
TradingView for charting

CoinMarketCap/CoinGecko for fundamentals

Glassnode or CryptoQuant for on-chain analysis

Messari for research

ðŸ§˜ Mindset Reminders:
Donâ€™t chase pumps

Donâ€™t panic sell dips

The goal is consistency, not daily dopamine

Let compounding work â€” focus on capital preservation first, profits second

âœ… Optional Enhancements:
Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into strong assets for a passive strategy layer

Integrate a macro view: monitor Fed policies, global risk appetite, and market cycles

Use automated alerts or bots for executing predefined conditions


When coding
- Security is of primary concern.
