# PR Review Analysis - Pandas Import Issues

## Issue Analysis
The reported pandas import issues in src/prediction/utils/caching.py are **false positives**.

## Verification Steps Performed:
1. ✅ Confirmed pandas is properly imported at line 8: `import pandas as pd`
2. ✅ Tested all pandas functionality used in the file:
   - pd.DataFrame and pd.Series isinstance checks (lines 413, 416)
   - pd.util.hash_pandas_object() calls (lines 415, 418)
   - All operations execute without NameError
3. ✅ Python syntax compilation passes
4. ✅ Module imports and functions correctly in runtime tests

## Root Cause
The pandas usage was recently added in commit 03a872c to fix cache key inconsistency. 
The reviewer tool may have analyzed an earlier version or had a caching issue.

## Conclusion
No code changes are needed. The pandas import is present and all functionality works correctly.
The reported issues can be marked as resolved.
