# Railway Quick Start Guide

Deploy your AI Trading Bot to Railway in 5 minutes! ðŸš„

## What is Railway?

[Railway](https://railway.com) is a modern deployment platform that simplifies infrastructure. It's a great alternative to AWS with:

- **Simpler setup** - No complex EC2, VPC, or IAM configuration
- **Built-in databases** - PostgreSQL with automatic backups
- **One-click deploys** - Deploy from Git with zero configuration
- **Cost-effective** - Pay only for what you use, typically 40-60% cheaper than AWS
- **Auto-scaling** - Automatically scales based on demand

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Prerequisites âœ…

- [Railway account](https://railway.app) (free tier available)
- Your trading bot code
- Binance API keys

### 2. Setup Railway ðŸš„

```bash
# Install Railway CLI (choose your platform)
# Linux/macOS:
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh

# macOS with Homebrew:
brew install railway

# Login to Railway
railway login
```

### 3. Deploy Your Bot ðŸš€

```bash
# Clone your repository (if not already local)
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai-trading-bot

# Run the setup script
./bin/railway-setup.sh

# Follow the prompts:
# - Enter project name (or create new)
# - Choose environment (staging recommended first)
# - Add PostgreSQL database (recommended: yes)
```

### 4. Configure API Keys ðŸ”‘

The setup script provides a URL to your Railway dashboard. Set these variables:

**Required:**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build failing?**
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --deployment-id <deployment-id>

# Common fixes:
# - Verify requirements.txt is correct
# - Check Dockerfile syntax
# - Ensure all files are committed to git
```

**Health check failing?**
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Review application logs
railway logs --filter "health"

# Verify environment variables
railway variables
```

**API connections failing?**
```bash
# Verify API keys are set
railway variables | grep BINANCE

# Check permissions on Binance account
# - Spot trading enabled
# - IP restrictions (Railway uses dynamic IPs)
```

## Migration from AWS

Already using AWS? You can run both in parallel:

1. **Keep AWS running** (no downtime)
2. **Set up Railway** with staging environment
3. **Test thoroughly** on Railway staging
4. **Switch production traffic** when confident
5. **Decommission AWS** resources

Your existing AWS scripts remain unchanged - Railway is a completely separate deployment option.
